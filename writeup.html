  <h1>Project Overview</h1>
  <t>In this project we were tasked to pick a website and redesign it using responsive redesign techniques.
    I picked a storage container renting website that was in dire need of a redesign. My goal was to simplify
    the aesthetic, make the necessary information more clear and obviously make the design responsive.

      <h2>PART 1: IDENTIFYING USABILITY PROBLEMS</h2>
      <h3>Website Selection:</h3>
      <p>I looked on google maps to find a small business that could use a website revamp. In the middle of Kentucky I
        found Franklinâ€™s Self Storage. I chose this website because its functionality is straightforward yet the design
        is messy and unclear.
      </p>
      <h3>Finding Problems:</h3>
      <h4>Usability Issues:</h4>
      <p> Of course the main issue with this website is its lack of responsiveness to different screen sizes.
        It does not adjust the size at all for different size screens which makes navigating very difficult.
        The website information layout is not intuitive nor is it aesthetic to look at. I want to make the hours,
        location and services much more clear on the first page. Lots of the text is hidden because of low contrast and
        I want to fix that. The website also is not friendly and welcoming: I want to provide a better image to text
        ratio and simultaniously communicate more information.
      </p>
      <h4>Learnability</h4>
      <p>This website is very simple so it is quite easy to learn. However, people go to this website for information and if the information
        is not obvious and straight forward then customers will be lost! I am hoping to 
      </p>
      <h4>Accessibility:</h4>
      <p> The primary accessibility issue is the hard-to-read areas. This occurs because of low-contrast, poor color
        choice, font choice etc. Page resizing also totally messes up the organization of the website. All of the images
        are missing alt text.
      </p>

    <h2>PART 2: PROTOTYPING</h2>
    <div>
      <t>In this portion of the assignment I created a style guide using Figma. My aim was to keep the aesthetic
        simple so as to not overcrowd the user. I have one main button in the design which I layout as well as the main
        color pallete and the fonts.
      </t>
      <h2>Style Guide:</h2>
      <img src="images/guide.png" alt="original image" style="width: 50%;">
    </div>
    <div>
      <t>In this portion of the assignment I created 3 hi and lo fi prototypes for the 3 screen sizes that I am going to be
        designing for. I called out the main components of the design. As this is very simple, it is made up of 5 different
        components.
